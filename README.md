# Theme pack support GUI for SailfishOS

This app is a GUI for [Theme pack support for Sailfish OS](https://github.com/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos) - it does not implement anything on its own but strictly uses the Theme pack support script to do things.

For communication with original script it uses [expect](http://linux.die.net/man/1/expect) tool, which is a dependency.

It now supports fonts and icons, in future I plan also support of songs.

You can download the .rpm package on [openrepos](https://openrepos.net/content/rikudousennin/gui-theme-pack-support-sailfish-os).
